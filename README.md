This is the python code of my thesis titled "The research on preference learning algorithm based on fuzzy support vector machine and its applicaiton". There are two projects with respect to two sections in the thesis.

## feature engineering 1.1

This folder `feature engineering` refers to the jupyter notebook that process the raw data in Parkinson dataset. 

## FSVM 1.2

This folder includes all codes used in section 3 and 4. In this folder, I used two subfolders to store python code of the two sections.
